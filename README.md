# SafeHer
Final Year Project

# How to Navigate and Read the Code on GitLab
Our GitLab repository contains two key versions of our project, reflecting the evolution from our initial Django-only prototype to our final web application using Django as a backend and React as a frontend. To help you navigate the repository and locate the most relevant code, follow these guidelines:

Master Branch (master): This branch contains our initial prototype of the website, built purely with Django. The source code for this version is located in:

 		master → src


App Branch (App): This is the main branch containing the final version of our web application. This is the project we are presenting, and it can be found in:

 		App → sources


# Why We Structured It This Way
Initially, we started with a Django-only prototype, where the entire website was built using Django as both the backend and frontend. However, as the project evolved, we decided to integrate React for the frontend while keeping Django as the backend. This required significant changes to the codebase.

Rather than overwriting our original prototype, we chose to create a separate branch (App) where we built the final version of the project. This approach allowed us to:
Keep both versions of the project (the prototype and the final app) without losing any progress.

Prevent conflicts and confusion while developing the new React based frontend.
Ensure we have a backup in case we needed to refer back to the initial Django only version.

Clearly separate development phases, making it easier for others to understand how the project evolved.

# Overview
SafeHer is designed to offer women an innovative and discreet tool for enhancing personal safety in everyday life. By focusing on real time tracking, emergency assistance, and stealth features, SafeHer aims to provide a reliable sense of protection in potentially dangerous situations. Unlike other safety apps that may offer isolated functionalities, SafeHer integrates advanced and user centric features into a seamless experience that prioritizes both effectiveness and discretion.

# Purpose and Vision
The core objective of SafeHer is to empower women with a practical and easy-to-use safety tool that can be used in moments of uncertainty or danger. Women's safety is an ongoing concern in many parts of the world, and the app addresses this need by offering a comprehensive set of tools that function in both preventive and reactive capacities. The vision behind SafeHer is to create a trustworthy platform that increases users' sense of control and confidence when navigating potentially unsafe environments.

# Key Features
Each feature of SafeHer is designed to address specific safety scenarios women might face, providing layered security options that work together to mitigate threats.

- Discreet Emergency Assistance:
SafeHer incorporates a emergency button that can be activated with minimal effort, ensuring the user can get help without drawing attention. This can be triggered by gestures or voice commands, allowing for rapid response during a crisis. The app automatically sends the user's GPS location to predefined contacts or authorities, removing the need for users to interact with their phone during a stressful moment.

- Real-Time Tracking for Peace of Mind:
Sharing one's live location with trusted contacts is essential for safety, particularly when traveling alone. SafeHer’s real time GPS tracking enables friends or family to follow a user’s journey and receive alerts if any unexpected deviations occur, such as detours or sudden stops. This feature offers an additional layer of security by making sure someone is always aware of the user’s whereabouts.

- Emergency Simulation to Deter Threats:
An incoming call from a loved one can sometimes help diffuse tense or suspicious situations. SafeHer includes an option to simulate a phone call, giving the user an excuse to break away or divert unwanted attention. This feature acts as a psychological deterrent, buying time or allowing the user to safely exit a precarious situation.

- Stealth Mode to Evade Detection:
SafeHer is equipped with a “fake interface” feature, allowing it to disguise itself as a benign app like a calendar or notes tool. This ensures that potential attackers or suspicious individuals are unable to easily deactivate the app or realise it’s being used for safety purposes.

- Community-Based Hazard Warnings:
Users can report unsafe areas or situations directly through the app, creating a live, interactive map that helps other users avoid potential threats. This community driven feature empowers users to warn others of danger zones, fostering a culture of shared safety and vigilance.

- Check In Reminders for Continuous Safety Monitoring:
Regular check in notifications prompt the user to confirm their safety. If the user fails to respond, alerts are sent to their emergency contacts, ensuring that immediate action can be taken if something is amiss.


# Why SafeHer Stands Out
- Empowering Discretion:
One of the app’s core strengths lies in its focus on discreet operation. In emergency situations, users may not have the time or ability to fumble through a phone to seek help. By enabling gesture and voice activated alerts and concealing its real function behind a fake interface, SafeHer provides a hidden yet powerful tool that prioritises user safety while minimising the risk of detection by aggressors.

- Layered Safety Approach:
Rather than offering a one size fits all solution, SafeHer combines preventive and reactive tools, catering to various types of threats. From real-time tracking and audio/video recording to facial recognition alerts, the app equips users with multiple layers of defense. This integrated approach maximises the chances of successful intervention and response in different scenarios.

- Community Engagement:
SafeHer’s emphasis on community input through hazard reporting adds value to the user experience by providing real time insights into local dangers. This dynamic exchange of safety information makes the app a valuable resource not just for individual users but also for entire communities, encouraging a proactive and collaborative approach to safety.

# Real-World Application and Feasibility
For SafeHer to achieve its goal of enhancing women’s personal safety, it is essential to evaluate its technical feasibility and market relevance. Features like GPS tracking and automatic recording require robust infrastructure, ensuring seamless performance under pressure. Privacy and data security are also top concerns, especially with the storage of sensitive information like location data and video recordings. To address these, SafeHer will employ state of the art encryption and secure cloud services to protect user data.

User feedback and extensive testing will be integral to the app's success, as understanding the real world challenges users face will guide feature refinement and updates. Partnerships with local authorities and safety organisations can further enhance the app’s credibility and functionality, enabling direct integration with emergency services where applicable.

# Target Audience and Market Potential
The market demand for personal safety solutions is high, with a growing awareness of the unique safety challenges women face in urban and rural environments alike. SafeHer aims to attract a diverse user base, spanning different age groups, professions, and geographies. By offering a freemium model where basic functionalities are free and premium features are accessible via subscription SafeHer positions itself as an affordable, scalable solution in the global market.

Additionally, the app’s appeal can be expanded through strategic partnerships and marketing campaigns that align with women’s organisations, safety focused brands, and social initiatives. This ensures that SafeHer not only functions as a tech tool but also resonates as part of a broader movement toward gender safety and empowerment.

# Conclusion
SafeHer is more than just an app, it’s a personal safety companion for women, leveraging technology to provide peace of mind and actionable solutions in times of danger. By focusing on discretion, real time intervention, and community driven safety, SafeHer stands out as a comprehensive and essential tool for today’s safety conscious women.
